Deployerjs Debian-Repo
=======================

This is a fresh debian-repo, bootstrapped by deployerjs. You should edit this
README to suit your needs.

However, add it to your sources.list, there's always great stuff here!

We've got two flavors:

    deb file:%%repoPath%%/debian development main
or
    deb file:%%repoPath%%/debian production main

development is the stuff that's ahead of the last tagged version.

You need your gpg-key to make sure the packages are really created by you:
    cat %%repoPath%%/debian/pubkey.asc | apt-key add -

Packages are build for %%arch%%.
